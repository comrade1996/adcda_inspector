- **Theme**: Custom dark/light theme system
- **Storage**: Secure storage for tokens and preferences
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Firebase App Distribution
- **Platforms**: Android, iOS, Web

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.32.8 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / Xcode for platform-specific development
- Firebase project setup for distribution

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd adcda_inspector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up environment files:
   ```bash
   # Copy template files and configure with your credentials
   cp assets/env/.env.dev.template assets/env/.env.dev
   cp assets/env/.env.staging.template assets/env/.env.staging
   cp assets/env/.env.prod.template assets/env/.env.prod
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run --flavor dev  # Development
   flutter run --flavor staging  # Staging
   flutter run --flavor prod  # Production
   ```

## UAE Pass Integration

The application integrates with UAE Pass for secure government authentication:

### Features
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Standard authorization code flow with PKCE
- **Multi-Environment**: Support for development, staging, and production
- **App Detection**: Automatic detection of UAE Pass app installation
- **Browser Fallback**: Web-based authentication when app is unavailable
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted token storage with automatic refresh

### Configuration
Environment-specific UAE Pass settings are configured in:
- `assets/env/.env.dev` - Development (Sandbox)
- `assets/env/.env.staging` - Staging environment
- `assets/env/.env.prod` - Production environment

## Application Flow

### 1. Authentication
- Launch app ‚Üí Splash screen with logo
- Login screen with UAE Pass integration
- Biometric authentication option
- Secure token management

### 2. Dashboard
- Modern card-based interface
- Statistics overview (Pending, Completed, Overdue, Today)
- Quick access to surveys and settings
- Theme toggle (Dark/Light mode)

### 3. Survey Completion
- Dynamic question loading
- Multiple question types with validation
- Progress tracking with navigation
- Answer persistence across sessions
- Preview before submission

### 4. Submission & Sync
- Offline capability with local storage
- Automatic sync when online
- Submission confirmation
- Result tracking and history

## Development Guide

### Environment Setup

1. **Firebase Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Add your Firebase configuration files
   android/app/google-services.json
   ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
   ```

2. **UAE Pass Setup**:
   - Register your app with UAE Pass
   - Configure redirect URIs: `adcdainspector://uaepass/callback`
   - Update environment files with your credentials

3. **Keystore Setup** (Android):
   ```bash
   # Generate keystore for release builds
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
   ```

### Building & Testing

```bash
# Development build
flutter run --flavor dev

# Release builds
flutter build apk --release --flavor prod
flutter build appbundle --release --flavor prod
flutter build ios --release --flavor prod

# Run tests
flutter test
flutter test --coverage
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes automated GitHub Actions workflows:

### Features
- **Automated Builds**: Android APK/AAB and iOS IPA generation
- **Firebase Distribution**: Automatic distribution to testers
- **Environment Management**: Separate builds for dev/staging/prod
- **Security**: Encrypted secrets management
- **Artifact Storage**: Build artifacts with 30-day retention

### Setup
1. Configure GitHub Secrets:
   - `FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
   - `KEYSTORE_BASE64`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`

2. Trigger builds:
   - Push to `main` or `develop` branches
   - Manual workflow dispatch with custom release notes

## Deployment

### Firebase App Distribution
- **Internal Distribution**: ADCDA team members only
- **Tester Groups**: Organized by department/role
- **Release Notes**: Automated with build information
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with build numbers

### Production Release
1. Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Test thoroughly in staging environment
3. Create production build via GitHub Actions
4. Distribute to production tester group
5. Monitor for issues and feedback

## Security Considerations

- **OAuth 2.0 + PKCE**: Secure authentication flow
- **Token Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Certificate Pinning**: API communication security
- **Biometric Protection**: Device-level security integration
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate configurations per environment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **UAE Pass Authentication Fails**:
   - Check redirect URI configuration
   - Verify environment variables
   - Ensure UAE Pass app is installed (for app-based flow)

2. **Build Failures**:
   - Verify all secrets are configured in GitHub
   - Check keystore and certificate validity
   - Ensure Firebase configuration files are present

3. **Theme Issues**:
   - Clear app data and restart
   - Check system theme settings
   - Verify theme controller initialization
